# DirectNtApi
A Simple method to make ntapi function calls *without* importing or walking the export table.\
Works under Windows 7, 8 and 10.

# This method is OLD
And is therefore **not recommended** to be used! (It serves as a **POC**(**P**roof **O**f **C**oncept))


DirectNtApi is a project I created in 2011. I was looking for a method to call the ntdll api but without importing or typedef. 
My primary motivation was simply "because it interested me" - not to mention hooking ntdll.dll is not creative, and not as interesting.

See usage.txt for details.

May someone find a value in this nine year old code =>

Be well,
